                    <p>
        I have successfully completed the Flutter course on Udemy, taught by Dr. Angela Yu. Throughout the course, I gained a comprehensive understanding of Flutter and Dart, and developed practical skills by building a range of mobile applications. The course covered fundamental concepts such as widgets, state management, and UI design, as well as more advanced topics like navigation, working with APIs, and integrating databases. Dr. Yu’s clear and engaging teaching style made the learning experience both enjoyable and effective.</p>
                    <p>During the course, I created several hands-on projects, including a BMI Calculator, Mi Card (a personalized digital card), 8 Ball (a fun fortune-telling app), Destini (a famous adventure game), and Todoey (a to-do list app). These projects helped me solidify my understanding of Flutter and allowed me to apply my learning in real-world app development. I now feel confident in my ability to design and build mobile applications using Flutter, ready to tackle a variety of challenges in the mobile development space.</p>

                    <p>In just three days, I delved into the world of Linux and Raspberry Pi. I began by mastering fundamental Linux commands and file system management. Then, I ventured into the realm of Raspberry Pi, setting up the hardware and experimenting with GPIO control using Python. I even took a step further into machine learning, exploring ThonyIDE in Raspberry Desktop for Python Coding. Throughout this intensive learning journey, I gained a solid understanding of Python programming, enabling me to create simple projects like LED control and camera module operation . This rapid exploration has ignited my passion for embedded systems and opened doors to countless possibilities.</p>
